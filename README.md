# UConv

__UConv__ is a tiny C header-only library for converting between UTF-8 and UTF-32 text. Its aim is to provide robust error-handling.

# Usage:

Include the header in your project and define the implementation macro where needed. To install globally, use `make install PREFIX={prefix}`. By default, `PREFIX=/usr/local`.
